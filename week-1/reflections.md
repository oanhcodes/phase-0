# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
## For this challenge, I learned about the Pomodoro technique. This technique involves working for 25 minutes without interruptions and following each session with a 5 minute break. This seems like it will be an effective way for me to help me keep my focus. “Time Boxing” is the act of setting a specific amount of time to work on projects alone or in a group. During pairing sessions, time boxing could be used to switch roles as driver and navigator while working on a challenge. To manage my time during Phase 0, I plan on creating a 3-4 hour work block every morning to work on challenges. By breaking down that work block into time boxes, I will have set break times and not necessarily work until a complete a problem. I just downloaded the Headspace app to give mediation a shot too!

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
## What is a shell? What is "bash?"**
A shell is a program with access your computer’s operating system that allows you to execute commands efficiently.  Bash is the default shell program used on Linux and OS X computers.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**
To be honest, the most challenging thing this challenge was watching the introductory video first with no prior knowledge of the command line. Once I started the crash course and actively started practicing in Terminal, I felt much more comfortable.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**
Yes. It took me a little bit longer to try using xargs, sudo, chmod, and chown since I needed to research and find basic examples first.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**
cd: change directory is useful to quickly navigate around multiple directories
ls: list directory was very useful in provided a snapshot of all the contents in a directory
man: being able to look up a detailed description of any command will be very useful!

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**
-pwd: print working directory; this will print out the current directory a user is currently in.

-ls: list directory; displays all the contents in the directory a user is currently in

-mv: move a file (rename a file)

-cd: change directory; used to move around between different directories

-../: used to move up a path

-touch: make empty files, used to create a new empty file

-mkdir: make directory, used to make a new directory

-less: page through a file, used to a view a file

-rmdir: remove a directory, used to remove a directory that is empty

-rm: remove a file, used to remove a file

-help: use man or apropos to get detailed descriptions of command and relevant information that could be helpful
