# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
## For this challenge, I learned about the Pomodoro technique. This technique involves working for 25 minutes without interruptions and following each session with a 5 minute break. This seems like it will be an effective way for me to help me keep my focus. “Time Boxing” is the act of setting a specific amount of time to work on projects alone or in a group. During pairing sessions, time boxing could be used to switch roles as driver and navigator while working on a challenge. To manage my time during Phase 0, I plan on creating a 3-4 hour work block every morning to work on challenges. By breaking down that work block into time boxes, I will have set break times and not necessarily work until a complete a problem. I just downloaded the Headspace app to give mediation a shot too!

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
## What is a shell? What is "bash?"**
A shell is a program with access your computer’s operating system that allows you to execute commands efficiently.  Bash is the default shell program used on Linux and OS X computers.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**
To be honest, the most challenging thing this challenge was watching the introductory video first with no prior knowledge of the command line. Once I started the crash course and actively started practicing in Terminal, I felt much more comfortable.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**
Yes. It took me a little bit longer to try using xargs, sudo, chmod, and chown since I needed to research and find basic examples first.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**
cd: change directory is useful to quickly navigate around multiple directories
ls: list directory was very useful in provided a snapshot of all the contents in a directory
man: being able to look up a detailed description of any command will be very useful!

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**
-pwd: print working directory; this will print out the current directory a user is currently in.

-ls: list directory; displays all the contents in the directory a user is currently in

-mv: move a file (rename a file)

-cd: change directory; used to move around between different directories

-../: used to move up a path

-touch: make empty files, used to create a new empty file

-mkdir: make directory, used to make a new directory

-less: page through a file, used to a view a file

-rmdir: remove a directory, used to remove a directory that is empty

-rm: remove a file, used to remove a file

-help: use man or apropos to get detailed descriptions of command and relevant information that could be helpful

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
## If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**
To create a new repository, go to your GitHub account and press the + next to your profile image. Select the option for “New Repository." Name your repo, adjust the privacy and license settings, and finalize by clicking “Create repository”. To fork a repo, click the “Fork” button at the top right of the repo page you would like to copy. Select the username/organization you would like to fork to. To clone a repo to your computer, copy the URL listed on your forked/personal repo. Open Terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory. Enter git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED. You will be asked to enter your GitHub username and password if you used the HTTPS url to clone.  Execute ls command to confirm that the file was cloned to match the repo. You should fork a repository so you can make changes to an existing file that can be merged into the master after you commit.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**
I did not run into too many troubles setting up git and GitHub. During the forking and cloning process, I learned that I need to strengthen my abilities using the command line. I also learned that Git is local repository and GitHub is a remote repository. All changes I make in Git need to be pushed to GitHub if I want it to be accessible on GitHub.
