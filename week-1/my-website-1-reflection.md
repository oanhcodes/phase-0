#Describe what open source means.
Open source means that and file or project is shared and available for customization. This means users may able to download, modify, and distribute the file depending on the license type.
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is a great way to foster collaboration and innovation since it allows other people to get involved and help customize projects. Since I am new to coding, having my code be visible to strangers is a litle nerve-racking, however, the feedback will only help strengthen my current knowledge. Although I can understand why some people would be protective of their ideas, I think it would be flattering and inspiring to see people modify and work and give feedback on my code. I am definitely pro open source! 
#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Selecting a proper license will ensure that other people are making modifications and distrbuting the work within certain terms. It protects you as the original creator of the code. By knowing what licenses are out there, developers have options that can protect their work.
#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I strengthened my knowledge of how to move through the stages of tracking changes in Git. I did have an "aha" moment when I made my first website! Very cool! It's not a struggle, but I always have to remind myself to pull the new master file back to my local repo!
#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
All the resources provided were very helpful. I did not need to seek additional resources.
