Reflection Section
What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the 
state_data file?
One of the hashes uses the standard syntax with ==>, and the other uses 
symbols. Symbol values always have the same object id. They do not get 
reassigned each time they are used. This is handy when you want to use it 
multiple times such as a key in a hash.

What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
This is a way to link to another file to access data like test code. Require 
relative does not require you to write the entire path to get to the file. If 
you use require only, you would need to write the entire path.

What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
You can use the each method to iterate on the every key and value pair.

When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
We did not need the arguments in order to call the method.

What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
What the purpose of instance variables and method are. Why symbols are 
different than variables. And the importance of understanding different scopes.
