  <h1>Introduction to Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h1>
  <h4>December 6, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      What is version control? Version control is system that keeps track of your file(s) and all the changes you’ve made to them over time. This means that you are able to return to a previous version of your work at any time. Mess something up? Well, fear not! With version control, you can just jump back to an earlier version and start working again. Cool right?
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of keeping track of all the changes you make individually, version control takes all the changes you’ve made and and bundles it into a something called a commit. A commit is a similar to save point or snapshot. It is a place you can always return to in your work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control is a great way to keep track of individual work flow, but where it really shines is in a collaborative setting. By using version control, it is possible for multiple people to make edits and changes to a file at the same time without overwriting each other’s work. This is possible because version control merges two or more commits together into a new document.
    </p>

        Git is a version control system you can download that is popular with developers. It is accessed from your computer’s terminal so you will need to be familiar with how to use the command line. The command line is a way to navigate and browse your computer using text-only commands that is more efficient that manually clicking and searching for files. Before using git, it’s a good idea to go over basic command line commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        To save and keep track of your changes using git, you use basic commands like add and commit. One of the great features of git is that you can create and work in “branches”. The changes you make and test in branches won’t effect the “trunk”, the master version or your work, until you’re ready to merge all your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that git lives in locally in your computer and that is is different from GitHub, which is a remote repository. A remote repository is a place where your directories and files can live on the web. If you want to share your files and changes with other people, you will need to push it to a GitHub or a similar remote repository. By sharing to a remote repository like GitHub, programmers can share their code and start collaborating.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let’s wrap this up.

        1. Version control is a way to keep track of your files and the changes made to it.

        2. Git is a popular version control software that lives in your computer locally. You can use it to keep track of changes by making commands in your computer’s terminal. Git allows you to work in branches so you can test your code before merging it into your master code.

        3. Github is a remote repository where you can push and pull code. It is a place where people can share their code and collaborate.

        Happy coding!

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used the article tag around my blog because the content has a header (my blog title) and makes sense on its own.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements are laid out on the page following the flow of the html code. It will factor in formating and position cues in the HTML and any linked stylesheets.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that I can save time by creating snippets in Sublime which are templates that I can reuse. I definitely think as I start building more websites, I will start creating more complex snippets to save time and build more efficiently. I am still learning how to use a Mac, so learning keyboard shortcuts is on my to-do list to make researching and actual coding more efficient.
