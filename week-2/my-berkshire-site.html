<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I had a lot of fun! Being able to see the end results of a few simple lines of code was really inspiring. I'm looking forward to making more websites.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I enjoyed using html because it feels very intuitive and practical. I enjoyed the research because I got to see lots of examples of source code which helped reinforce the tags I just learned.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
My pairing partner and I both made sure to use spaces and indentations to make the code easier to read. We added formatted a few sections of this code in the HTML to make it look closer to the Berkshire Hathawaysite. We should avoid doing that again in the future to keep with best practices. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The only bad thing I can gather about HTML with my current experience is that it is very easy to make a mistake and code can get very very long. It can see the importance of making many commits and testing often to make sure you don't lose a lot of work. What seems good about HTML is that it is standard, simple, and easy to learn to read and write.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Practice! I also try writing down tags on paper to remember them. Making flashcards can be helpful too.
